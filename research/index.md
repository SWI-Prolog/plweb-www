# SWI-Prolog and research

SWI-Prolog is in use for many research projects. As SWI-Prolog is
mainly being developed and maintained in an academic research
environment, please consider helping us (and yourself):

  - Link to the SWI-Prolog website and [Publications](</Publications.html>)

  - Get your project listed on the Publications page. Register at the site and add a
    post that links to your project.

  - Sometimes there are opportunities to extend SWI-Prolog in the
    context of your research program.

    - Implementing additional generic infrastructure that makes your research easier allows you to contribute this
      infrastructure to SWI-Prolog.  This makes your code more
      sustainable, and your code will reach a wider audience.

    - You may contact us for cooperation opportunities.
