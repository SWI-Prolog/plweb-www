---+ XPCE Screens -- BOOT Multi-Criteria Tool

			[[multi.gif]]

This screendump shows one of the windows of the Multi Criteria Analysis
Tool of BOOT.

The top window shows the alternative equipment and their utility
ranking. The bottom view shows the criteria considered and their
relative weight. The rightmost buttons on this window provide access to
an editor to modify the `utility-function'. All relations are updated
real-time and all values are modified through direct manipulation (i.e.
dragging the bar).
