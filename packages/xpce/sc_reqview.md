---+ XPCE Screens -- BOOT Requirement View

			[[reqview.gif]]

This screendump shows part of an overview of training-equipment
requirements and possible solutions derived from a system named BOOT. It
illustrates the possibilities of XPCE tables.

BOOT extracts training equipment requirements using a dialogue and
backward-chaining rule-based inference engine. Subsequently, a
[[Multi-Criteria][sc_multi.txt]] analysis tool is used to determine the
most effective training equipment.

BOOT has been developed by TNO-FEL for the Royal Netherlands Navy.
