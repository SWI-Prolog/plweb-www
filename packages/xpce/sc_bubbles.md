---+ XPCE Screens -- Bubbles

				[[bubbles.gif]]

The Bubbles tool was developed to study high-school student behaviour
while experimenting in an unknown world. The student can define the
initial volumes for three substances with unknown interaction and press
the start-button. The application then animates the experiment. First
the main vessel is filled, then the fire starts burning, bubbles are
produced and the amount of magnum is measured. The right diagram
provides measurement values for the frequency at which bubbles are
created. The student can select at most 5 arbitrary points to measure.
