---+ XPCE Screens -- Optica Hypothesis ScratchPad

				[[hypoth.gif]]

This screendump shows the hypothesis editor of Optica. The user assigns
variable name to gauges in the Optica Tool. Next, this tool is started
and a new table is created. The table automatically makes columns for
all named gauges.

Pressing the camera reads the gauges, adding a row to the table.
Subsequent, diagrams may be created by dragging columns from the table
to the axis in the bottom-right window. The top-right window is used to
create formulas. Columns from the table can be used as arguments in
these formulas, and formulas can be added as new columns to the table.
