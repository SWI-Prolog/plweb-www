using lamps and lenses. Optica is a large application, covering the
modeling of `ideal-' and `real-lenses' various light-sources,
measurement tools for distances and angles, a graphical
`scenario-editor', annotation tools, logging facilities and an
`[[hypothesis scratchpad][sc_hypoth.txt]]'.

lines defining 107 classes and 660 methods. The installed application
requires 3 MB disk-space. Minimum system requirements are Windows-95 on
a fast 486 with 8MB memory. It runs without notable delays on a 160Mhz
Pentium with 16MB.
