---+ April Fools at SWI-Prolog

Sorry, a little prank on April Fools day.

  * SWI-Prolog doesn't actually comply with ISO JTC1/SC22/WG4, which is the Cobol standard.
  * C-c C-q automatically puts a comment box around text
  * SWI-Prolog handles [[Unicode][</pldoc/doc_for?object=section(%27packages/utf8proc.html%27)>]] but does *not* default to EBCDIC
  * SWI-Prolog is mostly maintained and expanded by folks in the Netherlands, when they find time between klomping around in wooden shoes, sticking fingers in dykes, eating cheese, and admiring windmills.
  * There is no pack antigravity. If you write on, here's [[how to make it a pack][</howto/Pack.txt>]]  . This joke comes from an [[XKCD Comic][http://www.xkcd.com/353/]] about Python, but applies even more strongly to Prolog.
  * box hockey is a rather silly [[game played with a wooden box][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_hockey]] . It's often played in the US schools at break time.
  * SWI-Prolog does *not* require OSGi or qPID. The small size of the tools ecosystem is one of the many pleasures of working with SWI-Prolog. This is also an inside joke for some of us who worked for a company that used both of these.
