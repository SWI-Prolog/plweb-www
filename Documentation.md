---+ SWI-Prolog Documentation

The SWI-Prolog is maintained as a mixture of LaTeX files and PlDoc
documentation in the source-code.  The documentation can be accessed
in various formats.

    * The [[download][Download.txt]] pages provide links to download
    the documentation in HTML and PDF format.

    * This server provides an
    [[integrated documentation search system][</pldoc/index.html>]].

Some, mostly old, material is still available through the
[[wiki][http://gollem.science.uva.nl/twiki/pl/bin/view/Main/WebHome]].
The still relevant parts will be moved to this website.
