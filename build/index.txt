---+ Build SWI-Prolog from source

The sources are common for all platforms, but the way to build them is
totally different for MS-Windows and all Unix/POSIX based platforms.

Unless you have a serious need to, we generally *discourage* building the *Windows* version
yourself, due to complexity. We provide [nightly builds](</download/daily/bin>) of Windows binary installers.
On the other hand, we generally *encourage* building
yourself on *|non-windows platforms|* because binaries tend to be less
portable and building is much easier.
