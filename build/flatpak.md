# SWI-Prolog flatpak images

As of SWI-Prolog 9.3.26, portable SWI-Prolog packages are distributed
as [flatpak](https://flatpak.org/) images.  This replaces the
[Snap](snap.html) packages distributed for older versions.

The SWI-Prolog flatpak page is
[here](https://flathub.org/apps/org.swi_prolog.swipl)

At the moment, the Flatpak version is particularly useful because
SWI-Prolog's GUI is now based on [SDL3](https://www.libsdl.org/).
While SDL is widely supported on Linux, SDL version 3 is only available
on the most recent distributions.
