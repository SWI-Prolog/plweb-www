---+ Guidelines for Linux package managers

Over time, each distribution has established one or more packages for SWI-Prolog
independently based on their own conventions.  As a result, nobody knows what SWI-Prolog is called and which packages to install.  We are guilty to this as
well by using the short =pl= as the default system name.

---++ Names of the executables

We wish to use the name *swipl* on all installations.  The system comes with
two helper programs, that are called *|swipl-ld|* and *|swipl-rc|*.

---++ Directory hierarchy

The default installation of SWI-Prolog creates the following items:

  $ _prefix_/lib/swipl-<version> :
  This is a completely self-contained hierarchy that supports multiple
  architectures.  Please do _not_ split this.  Almost all directories
  are search for relative to this directory or documented as located
  relative to this directory.  Note that the =doc= directory is used
  by the documentation system.

  $ _prefix_/bin/swipl, swipl-ld, swipl-rc :
  These binaries are relative symbolic links into the tree above.  do
  _not_ rename these as the link information is used to find the above
  hierarchy.  This keeps the package relocatable and this very same mechanism
  can be used to create relocatable applications from SWI-Prolog.

  $ _prefix_/man/man1/swipl.1, swipl-ld.1, swipl-rc.1 :
  The standard Unix manpages.  These files are localized based on the
  installation directories.

---++ Making multiple packages

We would like to see that the default swi-prolog package installs
the same development environment on every system.  The default toplevel
configure and make build all the packages we consider essential or small
enough the include anyway.  Debian likes small packages and we came to
the following division:

  $ swi-prolog-nox :
  Contains the core compiler and all standard libraries that do not
  introduce major new dependencies.
  $ swi-prolog-x :
  Contains xpce, the graphical front-end
  $ swi-prolog-odbc :
  Contains the ODBC interface
  $ swi-prolog-java :
  Contains the Java interface (JPL).
  $ swi-prolog-doc :
  Contains all documentation

The package =|swi-prolog|= depends on =|swi-prolog-nox|= and =|swi-prolog-x|=,
providing a good default system that does not introduce many dependencies
on a standard workstation environment.  See also Debian.txt.

---++ Building

The script =|build.templ|= (see unix.txt) can be used to build and install
the system.  If you want to revert to more low-level primitives this file
documents the common tweaks and the process.  This file is actively maintained,
so using it for building the distro will reduce your maintenance work.
  
---++ Patches

If you need patches that are not really specific to your distro, such as
incomplete cleanup in make distclean, missing DESTROOT or portability issues,
please send them to <mailto:bugs@swi-prolog.org>.
