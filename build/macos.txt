# Building SWI-Prolog on MacOSX

_Last updated: Oct 31, 2018, homebrew_

## Using Macports

Building SWI-Prolog for MacOS requires
[[Macports][http://www.macports.org/]]. In general, the Portfiles are
kept nicely up-to-date thanks to Paulo Moura.  If you are a Macport
user, SWI-Prolog can be installed simply using one of the commands
below.  The first installs the `stable' version and the second the
`development' version.  Note that most of the time developers are
better of using the development version.

  ==
  port install swi-prolog
  port install swi-prolog-devel
  ==

If you like to keep nice and lean system (i.e., if you do not want
Macports copies of X11, ODBC, etc), you still need to install several
prerequisites.  First:

  1. Xcode (can be installed as a free app from the appstore)
  2. Macports (download from http://www.macports.org/)
  3. X11.  This is an OS option for Lion (10.7) and must be installed
     from http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/ for Mountain Lion
     (10.8).

Next, you must install the following Macport libraries:

  ==
  port install cmake gmp jpeg libarchive libiconv libmcrypt ncurses \
               openssl ossp-uuid pkgconfig readline zlib pcre libedit
  ==

Next, you can download SWI-Prolog as a [[source
archive][</Download.html>]] or using [[GIT][</git.html>]]. After installing all dependencies SWI-Prolog can   be build according to
the generic instructions using [cmake](https://cmake.org/)   that can be
found
[here](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/swipl-devel/blob/master/CMAKE.md)

## Using Homebrew

[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/) provides an alternative to Macports.
The command below installs the latest _stable_ version of SWI-Prolog:

  ==
  brew install swi-prolog
  ==

The latest git version of SWI-Prolog can be installed with this command:

  ==
  brew install swi-prolog --HEAD
  ==

### Building from source using Homebrew for dependencies {#homebrew-deps}

As of version 7.7.21 the  SWI-Prolog   sources  are fully compatible for
building with dependencies provided by Homebrew. The dependencies can be
installed using

```
brew install \
     cmake \
     ninja \
     gmp \
     openssl \
     libarchive \
     readline \
     ossp-uuid \
     libyaml \
     unixodbc \
     berkeley-db \
     pcre \
     jpeg
```

Brew does not provide `junit.jar` which is   needed to run the JPL (Java
interface) tests. If you want to test  this get `junit.jar` as described
in  https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/download-and-install   and
install in =|/usr/local/share/java/junit.jar|=.

After installing all dependencies SWI-Prolog can   be build according to
the generic instructions using [cmake](https://cmake.org/)   that can be
found
