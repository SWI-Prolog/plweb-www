---+ SWI-Prolog Wiki facilities

The underlying data structure of this website consists mostly of
[[PlDoc][</pldoc/package/pldoc.html>]] Wiki documentation pages. The PlDoc wiki format is largely based on the _markdown_ dialect used by [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/manual/markdown.html). Since
Mar 2, 2011, these pages can be edited through a web interface.  Editing
is still quite immature.  This page describes the process.

To edit the wiki pages, you need to login to the site using your Google,
Yahoo or other [OpenID](http://openid.net/) account. Please use the
_login_ link in the bottom-right corner of each page or the *WIKI/LOGIN*
menu. Next, you can ask for permission to edit the wiki pages using
[this link](</register>).

After being granted permission to edit the wiki pages, use the
*WIKI/EDIT THIS PAGE* menu to open a page in edit mode. Make your changes,
add a commit summary message and optionally a more extensive comment.
Please respect the [wiki notation](</pldoc/man?section=wiki>).  You
can use the [sandbox](<sandbox>) to get used to the wiki notation.

To create a *|new file|*, reference a =|.txt|= file and click the
created link. The link turns red and becomes underlined if the
pointer is positioned on the link.
