---+ What is a bug?

That is not so easy to define, but roughly these are bugs:

  * Inconsistencies between standards (both ISO and de-facto) and
    system behavior.
  * Inconsistency between documentation and system behavior (which
    might be a bug in the documentation).
  * Crashes.  Basically, any reproducible crash is worth reporting
    unless it is flagged as a bug in the documentation or can be
    explained by C-stack overflow.  We made an [[analysis][Devel/CStack.txt]]
    of predicates that are sensitive to this issue.

Non-experienced users are often surprised by how Prolog behaves.  In the
vast majority of cases this is not a bug.  Use the mailinglist to find 
answers.

---++ What do I include in the bug-report?

Typically, a report must include the parts below to be meaningful.  This
is just a guideline, but if any of these parts are missing it is very likely that your report will not be answered at all or by additional questions.

  1. The version of SWI-Prolog you use and the operating system.
  2. A clear description on how to reproduce the issue.  Typically,
  this consists of:
     - A _complete_ program.  Please do not send merely a fragment
     because (1) it costs us a lot of time to complete and (2), we
     typically complete it differently and the problem doesn't reproduce.
     Small programs are better, but it isn't always worthwhile to spend
     effort in creating a small program.  If the program is big, do not
     include it in the first message, but merely describe that it is
     available and what it would take to obtain and run it.
  3. The behavior you observe.  If there are warnings or error messages,
  include at least the first couple of them _literally_.
  4. The behavior you expected.
