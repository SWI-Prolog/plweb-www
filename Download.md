# SWI-Prolog downloads

## Available versions

The *stable* release is infrequently updated.  It is fine for running basic Prolog code without surprises.  The *development* version is released roughly every two to
four weeks.  This is the recommended version for developers and users of applications
such as [SWISH](http://swish.swi-prolog.org) or [ClioPatria](http://cliopatria.swi-prolog.org).   Finally, the *GIT* and *daily* versions are for developers that want to contribute or have immediate access to patches.  These versions are generally fine, but occasionally suffer from regression.
