# Getting Started

_Getting Started_ with Prolog depends on your background and goal. Here
are some options.

  - __I don't know anything about Prolog and want to learn the language__.  Prolog is
    quite different than any other programming language you may know.   A background
    in math and functional programming helps to some extend.  Start with a good
    introduction text.  Examples are

      - [Simply Logical](http://book.simply-logical.space/)
      - [Learn Prolog Now](http://lpn.swi-prolog.org/)

    Both are online text books that embed [SWISH](https://swish.swi-prolog.org).
    SWISH is an __online version__ of SWI-Prolog.  SWISH differs from a local SWI-Prolog
    installation:

      - As it runs on a shared server it enforces a __sandbox__ that doesn't allow
        running any dangerous code and rejects code it cannot _prove_ to be safe.
      - No state is maintained between queries.
      - Input/output, concurrency and many other SWI-Prolog features are not or
        only in a limited way supported.
      - It does provide a nice web based interface that allows for rich output
	based on HTML or high level vizualization libraries such as
        [C3.js](https://c3js.org/)

  - __I've made my first steps at Prolog and want to start a real project.__ Start
    with a local installation for your platform.  Familiarise yourself with the
    SWI-Prolog [toplevel](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pldoc/man?section=quickstart)
    and the IDE tools such as the [GUI debugger](https://blog.inductorsoftware.com/blog/SWIPrologGraphicalDebugger).  Establish your debug/edit/reload cycle based on edit/1 and
    make/0.  The edit/1 primitive finds predicates, files, modules, etc. and hands
    their position to the built-in editor PceEmacs or the editor of your choice.

    SWI-Prolog comes with a lot of [features](https://www.swi-prolog.org/features.html)
    that may be useful to your project.  Also consider the
    [add-ons](https://www.swi-prolog.org/pack/list).

  - __I know some Prolog and I want to use SWI-Prolog for data analysis__.  Here
    SWISH may come really handy, but you do not want the limitations of the shared
    SWISH server.  You could consider a local installation of SWISH and R
    for SWI-Prolog, either from source or (starting) from the
    [Docker images](https://www.swi-prolog.org/Docker.html)

  - __I know some Prolog and I want to use SWI-Prolog as a (web) service__.  Start
    with a local installation for your platform and the
    [Web application tutorial](https://www.github.com/Anniepoo/swiplwebtut/blob/master/web.adoc)

  - __I consider using and deploying SWI-Prolog in a commercial project__.  You are
    probably wondering about the support status, how to connect the Prolog component
    to the other components of your company, where to find people, etc.  You may send
    an email to [[SWI-Prolog Solutions b.v.][<mailto:info@swi-prolog.com>]] for information
    or an appointment for a telco.
