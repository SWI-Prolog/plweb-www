# A Java interface to SWI Prolog is available using JPL.

JPL is a bidirectional interface between Java and Prolog. JPL is
integrated into the full SWI-Prolog distribution starting with SWIPL
version 5.4.x and rebuilt with SWIPL version 7.4.x.

Development repository can be found in
[SWI-Prolog/packages-jpl](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/packages-jpl).

Documentation can be found at [jpl7.org](http://jpl7.org/).

Examples are included in the directory `doc/packages/examples/jpl`
relative to the installation directory. These examples include embedding
Prolog in Java as well as the other way around.

JPL was originally designed by Fred Dushin and Paul Singleton.
