---+ SWI-Prolog IDE --- Prolog Navigator

			[[navigator.gif]]

The _|Prolog Navigator|_ provides an explorer-like view of a directory
holding Prolog files. Prolog-files can be expanded, showing their
contents. The screen-dump shows a loaded file =|bitem.pl|= containing three XPCE
classes (boxes). Inside class btext_item there is a predicate to_text/3
referencing 4 other predicates.

Menus provide _Consult_, _Edit_, access to the _Manual_ and _Debugger_.
