# PlDoc: The source documentation system

PlDoc is the SWI-Prolog source documentation system.  The system processes _structured comments_ using a markup that is close to the Doxygen variant of Markdown.  This wiki page provides some pointers to get started with PlDoc, including a sandbox that you can use to learn about the wiki format.  The same wiki format is used for may of the web pages at [swi-prolog.org](http://www.swi-prolog.org).  The links:
