## Getting help, asking questions, solving problems

There are several places you can get help or ask questions
about SWI-Prolog or Prolog programming in general.

    - The list of [[frequently asked questions][</FAQ/>]]

    - [SWI-Prolog Discourse forum](https://swi-prolog.discourse.group)
    (most likely place to get answered in 2019)

    - [SWI-Prolog non-specific user issue tracker at GitHub](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/issues/issues)
    (more like reporting an issue than asking a question)

    - StackOverflow questions with these tags:
    [swi-prolog](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/swi-prolog),
    [prolog](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/prolog)

    - To report bug/issue, see [bug.html](<bug.html>)

    - The Prolog IRC channel ##prolog on FreeNode
    can be accessed via [WebChat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##prolog)

It usually takes about one day for a volunteer to reply to your question.
We appreciate your patience.

    was kindly hosted by the University of Bonn. The archives of this
