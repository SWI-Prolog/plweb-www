## Asking questions

There are several places you can ask questions
about SWI-Prolog or Prolog programming in general.

    - [SWI-Prolog Discourse forum](https://swi-prolog.discourse.group)
    (most likely place to get answered)
    - [SWI-Prolog non-specific user issue tracker at GitHub](https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/issues/issues)
    (more like reporting an issue than asking a question)
    - [StackOverflow with swi-prolog tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/swi-prolog)

It usually takes about one day for a volunteer to reply to your question.
We appreciate your patience.

## Other places

    - The IRC channel #prolog at Freenode is for general Prolog discussion.
    You can access it via [WebChat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##prolog).
    - Prolog is discussed on the Usenet group [[comp.lang.prolog][<news:comp.lang.prolog>]]

## Old mailing lists

  - Before moving to Discourse (Feb 4, 2018), SWI-Prolog discussion was
    hosted as a [Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/swi-prolog).

  - Before being moved to a Google group (May 1, 2014), the mailing list
    was kindly hosted by the University of Bonn. The archives of this
